Fishy is the main game (play this normally).  Demonic_Fishy is an alternate version, with a slightly messed up win state (play if you dare).


Game Description:

You are a white fish that appears in the center of the screen.  Your goal is to eat fish that are smaller than you and avoid fish that are bigger than you.  As you eat fish, you will grow in size and be able to eat even bigger fish.  Once you become the biggest fish in the pond, you win the game!  ...Yay?


Controls:

Use the arrow keys to move the white fish.
Protip: You can bounce off the walls!
